Welcome to Voxel51's storybook. It serves as a sandbox for UI component development.

The components rendered in this sandbox represent a subset of the total components available for developing within Voxel51.

All components are implemented within the [React](https://reactjs.org/) framework using [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

State management is accomplished using [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/).

#### How to determine which Recoil hooks to use

1. Computing a value based on a list of one or more values (not in recoil)? - useMemo()
2. Deriving state from one or more recoil atoms/selectors? - selector()
3. Mutating state accross multiple atoms/selectors? - selector()
4. Mutating recoil/react state when local state changes (eg. useState())? - useEffect()
5. Reading / writing recoil state in an event handler (eg. onClick)? - useRecoilCallback()
